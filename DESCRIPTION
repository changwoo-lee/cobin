Description: Provides functions for cobin and micobin regression models, a new family of generalized linear models for continuous proportional data (Y in the closed unit interval [0, 1]). It also includes an exact, efficient sampler for the Kolmogorov-Gamma random variable. For details, see Lee et al. (2025+) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2504.15269>.
